# Food Inventory

##Introduction
The Food Inventory web application tracks an inventory of products for a store. You may view a listing of products for the store as well as perform CRUD operations for said products.

##Important
Please review the **entire document** below and follow all instructions; failure to follow instructions will significantly affect your consideration for the position you are applying for.

##Setup Instructions

###Minimum Requirements to Build
The solution was created with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015; the solution has also been tested to run in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013. In addition, to run the solution, you must have an instance of Microsoft SQL Server  available. Note that you can use Microsoft SQL Server Express, freely available, to satisfy this requirement.

####Getting Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
If you **do not have** Microsoft Visual Studio 2013-2015 available on your system you can get Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, which comes at **no cost**, from [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).

####Getting Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Express
If you **do not have** access to an instance of Microsoft SQL Server for development purposes you may download Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Express Edition, which comes at **no cost**, from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52679).

###Database
The SQL schema for this project is located in **DatabaseSchema.sql**. Use either an instance of Microsoft SQL Server or Microsoft SQL Server Express and update the proper configuration files (web.config within the Web Project) once the database has been set up for use on your system.

###Solution
The primary solution file is **FoodInventory.sln**; all necessary components for running the solution is either within the solution itself or automatically made available via nuget packages by performing a restore.

Within the solution there are three (3) projects.
* **FoodInventory** The front-end of the web application where all HTML/CSS3 mark-up and JavaScript code is located.
* **FoodInventory.API** All WebAPI related code is located within this project.
* **FoodInventory.Data** All data transfer objects and database-related code is located within this project.

##Instructions for Activity Completion
Complete **one (1)** of the following activities by the given deadline communicated to you via a separate message.

### Activity One - Import and Export

#### User Story
As a user of the Food Inventory Application I would like to import and export the listing of food into a Microsoft Excel file so that I can use Microsoft Excel for reporting purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. All rows in the imported Microsoft Excel file must be validated to meet the requirements for input into the database.
2. The application must tell the user if there are missing columns in the imported Microsoft Excel file and how many rows, if any, are invalid should there be invalid data.
3. The application must display to the user a message that the data from the Microsoft Excel file has been imported successfully and refresh the display of data within the web page upon successful import.
4. The application must allow exporting of the data into a compatible Microsoft Excel file with all rows **except** for the DeletedDate column.

### Activity Two - Attach Pictures to Products

#### User Story
As a user of the Food Inventory Application I would like to attach **one (1) or more** pictures to each product within the application so that users of the application can get a visual representation of each product currently available in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. The application should only allow users to attach JPEG and PNG image files to each product.
2. The application should only accept file sizes of up  to 500KB in size.
3. The user should be informed of these limitations and be prevented from uploading the file should said criteria not be met.
4. Each product/item listed should be allowed to have one or more pictures attached to them.
5. The user should be able to view the pictures associated with each product within the application.

### Activity Three - Track Sales of Products

#### User Story
As a user of the Food Inventory Application I would like to track the sales of each product so that I can know when the sale has taken place and how much of any given product I have left in my inventory.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. The application must track the following aspects of any given sale of a product:
  1. Date and time of sale
  2. Product Purchased
  3. Amount of units of the product purchased
  4. Discount in dollars, if any
  5. Type of payment
    * Credit
    * Debit
    * Cash
    * Check
2. When a sale is made, the amount of items purchased should be deducted from the current inventory of the product.
3. Sales should be made available in a separate section of the application via a report by which all columns are sortable.
4. Sales should be searchable by date or the type of product purchased.
5. If the amount of units of said product is zero (0) or the user is attempting to enter in a sale by which the amount purchased is more than what the store currently has then the sale should be rejected.

##Submission
You have two options for submitting the completed activity.

###Option One - Github
Create a **separate** project within Github and upload the results of your activity to that project. You may send the link to the separate repository to the provided location in the communication for the position you are being considered for.

####Notes
* Do **NOT** fork the repository; upload the results of the activity to a completely separate repository on Github.

###Option Two - Email Attachment
Zip up the completed project and send the entire exercise to the provided location in the communication for the position you are being considered for.

####Notes
* The entire zipped file should be no more than 10MB in size. Note that you may remove any packages folders; the bin directory for the separate projects within the solution, etc. to reduce space of the zip file.

###Final Submission Notes
* Note that whichever option you choose you must send the final results to the same location communicated to you.
* The separate communication must use the following subject:
  * **Activity ([Name of Activity Completed Here]) Results for .NET Developer Role.**
* The separate communication should either have the link to the separate Github repository with the completed activity or the attached zipped file.
* **No other types of submissions will be accepted.**
